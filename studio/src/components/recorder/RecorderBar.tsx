/* ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   The floating control bar.

   This renders in its OWN BrowserWindow — frameless, transparent,
   always on top, and marked `setContentProtection(true)` in
   `electron/screenRecorder.cjs` so it does not appear in the recording
   it is controlling.

   Which means it is a second renderer process, with no access to the
   recorder store: none of that state exists here. Everything it shows
   arrives as one `recorder:state` message, and every button it has is a
   message back. That is not a limitation to work around, it is the
   right shape — there is exactly one place a take can be paused, and it
   is the window that owns the MediaRecorders.

   It exists because the workspace window is hidden while a take runs. A
   recording you can only stop by unhiding the app you just hid is not a
   screen recorder.

   It lives OUTSIDE `src/video/` on purpose. Its siblings in
   `src/video/components/recorder/` are rendered inside `.video-workspace`
   and lean on the classes scoped to it; this window has no such wrapper,
   so every class here is either a Tailwind utility or a token from
   `tailwind.config.js` — nothing from `video-components.css`.
