/* ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   The platform icon set — one file, so it is one file to change.

   Phosphor, not lucide. The upgrade is not "nicer drawings": Phosphor
   ships SIX WEIGHTS of every glyph, and the one that matters is `fill`.
   A single-weight stroke set can only signal an active state by
   changing colour, which is why every toolbar in this app used to look
   flat — a selected tool and an unselected one were the same shape in
   two colours. Idle is `regular`, active is `fill`, and that reads
   instantly at 16px without any colour at all.

   **Every component imports icons FROM HERE, never from a package.**
   The names below are the ones the codebase already used, so swapping
   the underlying set again is this file and nothing else. That is the
   whole point of it existing: the last swap touched 52 files, and the
   next one should touch one.

   `weight` is a prop on every icon, so a call site that needs the fill
   variant asks for it inline:

       <Play weight={playing ? 'fill' : 'regular'} />

   Sizing goes through `size`, and stroke-based utilities (`stroke-[1.6]`)
   do NOTHING to a Phosphor glyph — it is a filled path, not a stroked
   one. Use `weight` instead.

/*
  THE AI MARK, and the one line in this file that is a product decision.

  Phosphor's `Sparkle` is the MULTI-star: a large four-point shine with
  two or three smaller ones around it, which is the glyph on every AI
  product shipped in the last few years. HANDOVER's Iconography note
  removed exactly that once already, in favour of the single four-point
  shine, and the migration to this set quietly put it back.

  `StarFour` is the single shine. Verified by counting subpaths in the
  packaged path data rather than by eye: Sparkle draws three to four
  shapes per weight, StarFour draws one.

  Exported under the name the codebase already uses, so the fix is this
  line and nothing else.
