/* ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   Timeline store — the edit state, and the only place it mutates.

   Structural rules this file follows:
     • Every mutation goes through immer, so no hand-rolled deep clones.
     • History is transactional: a 200-frame drag is ONE undo step, opened
       with `beginTransaction()` and closed with `commitTransaction()`.
     • The playhead lives here but is deliberately cheap to write — nothing
       in it triggers a history snapshot or a structural clone.
     • Components subscribe through the selector hooks at the bottom rather
       than pulling the whole store, which is what keeps 60fps playback from
       re-rendering the entire editor.

/* ── the time scale ─────────────────────────────────────────────
   One definition of how a millisecond becomes a pixel, and one clamp
   over it. Both used to be duplicated: the store clamped to 0.05..20
   in two places and `Timeline`'s wheel handler carried a THIRD copy of
   the same two numbers, so raising the ceiling in the store would have
   left ⌘-wheel silently stopping at the old one.

   The ceiling is real, not decorative. At MAX_ZOOM the scale is 4px
   per millisecond — at 30fps that is 133px per video frame, which is
   as far in as anything can honestly go: a video frame boundary is
   1000/fps ms and nothing exists between two of them, so the ruler may
   show milliseconds but must never imply a frame there.

   MAX_LANE_PX is measured, not guessed. This engine honours element
   widths up to 16,777,214px (2^24 - 2) and silently clamps past it, so
   a long project zoomed in far enough would have had its lanes, ruler
   and clips quietly disagree with the playhead. Half of that is the
   budget, leaving headroom for the ruler's overdraw past the content
   end. A project long enough to hit it gets a lower ceiling instead of
   a broken one.

      omitting the argument still toggles, which is what the header

          to be absorbed or a gap opens in the middle of the sequence.

          On a track with GAPS there is nothing to absorb: the clip is
          free-standing and should simply move. The old version absorbed
          unconditionally, which had two consequences. Free-standing clips
          were refused whenever the previous one would drop under 200ms —
          and because each absorption SHRANK that previous clip, one snap
          made the next one likelier to be refused. Four cuts laid off the
          beat, all within tolerance, snapped exactly one.

          Starting at i=1 was the other half of it: the first clip on a
          track has no predecessor to absorb into, so it was never snapped
          at all, even sitting alone 30ms off the beat.

      `open_starter_project` is a TOOL, so an agent can call it in a

      Fixed in the STORE and not at the call sites, for the same reason
      the lock was: a rule enforced where the data changes holds for
      the UI, the tools and anything written later. A re-added asset
