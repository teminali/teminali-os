   Auto zoom, from the cursor track.

   ── Two detectors, and why there are two ───────────────────────────

   Every screen recorder that does this well is doing one thing: pushing
   the frame in on whatever the viewer is meant to be looking at, and
   pulling back out before it becomes exhausting. The animation is not
   the hard part. Knowing WHERE to look is.

   **`momentsFromEvents` is the good one.** Given real input — clicks,
   scrolls and keystrokes from `electron/inputEvents.ts` — it does not
   guess at all. It clusters: a run of clicks in one place is ONE
   moment that holds for as long as the run; typing that follows a click
   extends that click rather than starting a second zoom, which is what
   makes filling in a form read as one continuous idea; a scroll burst
   is its own kind of moment and gets a gentler push, because reading is
   not pointing.

   **`findZoomMoments` is the fallback, and it is not a bad one.** The
   input hook is a native module and, on macOS, an Accessibility
   permission, so it is not always there. Without it this measures
   ATTENTION from the only signal that is: the pointer, 30 times a
   second. Somebody about to act on something moves the pointer to it
   and stops, and the stop is the signal. That catches clicks, because a
   click is preceded by a settle, and it catches "moved here to point at
   this" too. It misses a click made without moving first, and the UI
   says which detector ran rather than letting the difference be
   invisible.

   The user can also mark a moment during the take, with the bar or the
   Alt+Shift+Z shortcut. Those are explicit, so they always survive and
   they suppress an inferred moment next to them.

   ── The animation ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

   Zooms CHAIN rather than bounce. If a second moment arrives before the
   first has pulled out, the frame travels straight from one to the
   other at zoom instead of snapping back to full frame in between.
   Bouncing out and in over a two-second gap is the single thing that
   makes an auto-zoomed recording unwatchable.

   The curve is an EXPO-OUT bezier by default, not an ease-in-out, and
   the difference is most of the feel. `easeInOut` spends as long
   arriving as it does leaving, which reads as a slow machine; expo-out
   is almost all of the way there in the first third and then glides,
   which reads as a camera operator who already knew where they were
   going. The pull-out is the mirror of it, slower to leave and decisive
   at the end.

   That is right for a move you WATCH and wrong for a move you read
   through. On a screen tutorial the frame is full of words, and a push
   that is half-done in the first tenth of its duration relocates all of
   them before the eye has registered that anything moved. `ZoomShape`
   can therefore name its own curve, and `SMOOTH_SHAPE` names
   `GLIDE_CURVE` — eased at both ends, fitted to the kinetic-typography
   reference's own moves. See both for the numbers.

   And a small OVERSHOOT: the push goes 3% past its target and settles
   back over 140ms. It is the difference between a zoom that stops and a
   zoom that arrives. Optional, because on very dense text it can read
   as a wobble.

   ── And a second grammar, which thinks in FRAMINGS ─────────────────

   `cutIn` swaps all of the above for the way the reference video edits.
   It does not push in and pull out around each moment; it decides a
   sequence of FRAMINGS, holds each with a slow creep, refuses to go
   wide between two close shots unless the gap buys a whole rest shot,
   and ends the film on one long move back to the framing it opened on.
   `planCuts` is that, `CUT_SHAPE` is its numbers, and every one of
   those numbers was measured off the reference rather than chosen.

   The two are different edits rather than two settings of one, which is
   why several fields of `ZoomShape` go inert under `cutIn`.

   HOW the frame gets between two framings is a separate question from
   which framings they are, and it is `transitionMs`. At 0 it is a hard
   cut, which is what the reference does and what the skill shipped
   first. Above 0 the same two framings are joined by a move of that
   length on `curve`. `CUT_SHAPE` cuts; `SMOOTH_SHAPE` glides over
   400ms; they plan identical framings. That split was made when the
   tutorial skill needed to stop cutting: a screen recording is READ,
   and a hard cut to 2.8x relocates every word in one frame.

   Everything lands as ordinary keyframes on the clip's own transform.
   No hidden state, no special clip type: the result is something the
   user can drag, retime, or delete key by key in the editor. That is
   the whole point of generating an EDIT rather than a rendered effect.
   A cut is no exception — it is two keyframes with `hold` easing on the
   first, which the format already had and nothing had yet emitted.

 * pull back from a close framing to the framing it opened on. Each of
 * its 564 frames was matched against the frame it settles on with
 * SIFT + RANSAC — an estimator checked first against synthetic zooms of
 * known scale, which it recovered exactly — and a cubic bezier fitted to
 * the resulting scale trajectory. This is that fit, over the full 2100ms
 * of the move:
 *
 *     measured          [0.53, 0.47, 0.00, 1.00]   RMS 0.053
 *     SETTLE_CURVE      [0.33, 0,    0.2,  1   ]   RMS 0.114

 *     PUSH_CURVE        [0.16, 1,    0.3,  1   ]   RMS 0.164
 *
 * So none of the three already here is the same curve, and the shape is
 * why: expo-out is 90% done in its first third, whereas this move is 50%
 * done at 583ms, 90% at 917ms and 98% at 1717ms. It leaves unhurriedly,
 * covers most of the ground in the middle, and then has a long
 * asymptotic tail — a hand letting something coast to a stop rather than
 * an operator arriving.
 *
 * 20 consecutive frames in the middle of that move are too motion-blurred
 * for a feature matcher to place at all, which is the other half of why
 * it reads as fast: the fit is interpolated across them and the curve is
 * quoted with that stated rather than hidden.

 * 60fps, 564 frames — rather than chosen. What the measurements were:
 *
 * · **Three cuts, at 1267 / 3600 / 5333ms, and every one is HARD.** The
 *   mean absolute frame difference goes 0.22 -> 47.05 -> 0.85 across the
 *   first, 0.01 -> 34.54 -> 0.34 across the second, 0.01 -> 24.73 -> 0.26
 *   across the third. One frame each. No blend, no dip through black or
 *   white, no directional smear, no flash: `analyze_reference_video`
 *   finds zero flashes and the only "dissolve" it reports is the
 *   motion-blurred closing move, whose frames SIFT confirms are the same
 *   content in flight. **Transition duration: 0 frames, all three.** So
 *   `inMs` is 0 and there is nothing for `overshoot` or `settleMs` to do.
 *
 * · **Not cut to music.** `detect_beats` finds 0 real onsets in the
 *   audio; 1 of 3 cuts sits on the interpolated grid, which is chance.
 *   The tool's own verdict: "the edit is not following this track". So
 *   nothing here is a tempo.
 *
 * · **`factor` 2.8**, and it is the same number twice. The wide-to-close
 *   cut is x2.797 (SIFT + RANSAC, 29 inliers), and the closing move
 *   travels from 2.85x closer than the ending out to it. A film that
 *   cuts in by 2.80 and pulls out by 2.85 is one framing decision, not
 *   two. The other two cuts are x0.75 and x0.86 — lateral, changing
 *   which thing is on screen rather than how close it is.
 *
 * · **`holdMs` 2030** is the MEDIAN shot: 1267 / 2333 / 1733 / 4067ms.
 *
 * · **`driftPctPerSec` 3.0 — nothing is ever locked off.** Scale drift
 *   measured within each of the four shots: -2.9, +2.7, +5.0, +3.4 %/s.
 *   Three of four creep IN, and the median magnitude is 3.0.
 *
 * · **`closeMs` 2100**, the one animated move in the film. See
 *   `CLOSE_CURVE` for its shape and how it was fitted.
 *
 * `leadMs` is the one field carried over unexamined, and deliberately:
 * the reference has no input events in it, so it has nothing to say
 * about how far ahead of a click to cut.

 * tutorial tiring to watch, and for a reason that is specific to this
 * kind of footage rather than a matter of taste: the viewer is READING
 * the frame. A cut from wide to 2.8x close relocates every word on
 * screen between one frame and the next, and the eye has to find its
 * place again each time. Twenty of those in a two-minute take is
 * twenty re-reads.
 *
 * So: the framings, the hold, the drift and the closing move are
 * `CUT_SHAPE`'s, unchanged and still measured off that file — none of
 * that is what was wrong. What changes is that the frame TRAVELS
 * between them, on the curve the kinetic-typography reference uses for
 * exactly the same reason. Its author keyframes every one of his moves
 * with CapCut's "auto curve" and says why: "this is gonna give us a
 * much smoother motion than we had before."
 *
 *   · **`inMs` / `outMs` 400.** Measured off that reference, settle to
 *     settle — the gap between the last frame that is bit-identical to
 *     its neighbour before a move and the first one after it: 200, 400
 *     and 533ms across the three transitions where both ends are
 *     unambiguous. Median 400.
 *
 *   · **`curve` GLIDE_CURVE**, fitted to that reference's own scale
 *     trajectory at RMS 0.010. See the table on `GLIDE_CURVE` for what
 *     the alternatives score.
 *
 *   · **`overshoot` 0.** The reference's composition moves have no
 *     bounce in them at all. The bounce in that piece is on the WORDS
 *     as they arrive, which is a different layer and is where this
 *     skill puts it too.
 *
 *   · **`factor` 2.8, `holdMs` 2030, `driftPctPerSec` 3.0, `closeMs`
 *     2100** — all `CUT_SHAPE`'s, all measured, all unchanged. How

 * it cuts close-to-close and only opens out at the end. So the rule here
 * is that cutting back to rest has to buy a REST SHOT, meaning a whole

/**
 * Where the clip has to sit for a given point of it to land on the
 * canvas centre.
 *
 * The clip's box is `baseWidth * scale` wide and centred at
 * `canvasWidth / 2 + transform.x`. The content point at normalised `px`
 * therefore lands at `canvasWidth/2 + x - w/2 + px*w`, and setting that
 * equal to the canvas centre gives `x = w * (0.5 - px)`.
 *
 * ── The clamp, and why it is not simply "never show the edge" ───────
 *
 * Pushed toward a corner, an unclamped offset walks the edge of the
 * footage into frame and the viewer sees whatever is behind it. So the
 * travel is limited to the overhang the zoom bought, which is
 * `(w - canvasWidth) / 2`.
 *
 * That rule, applied strictly, has a consequence worth stating because
 * it is not obvious and it was measured rather than reasoned about:
 * **centring a point 10% from the edge needs a scale of 5.** At any
 * sane zoom a click on a toolbar cannot be brought to the middle, and
 * the frame ends up merely bigger near it rather than aimed at it. On a
 * take where the clicked thing was 14% across the frame, a 1.55x zoom
 * moved it to 14%.
 *
 * `edgeOverhang` is what fixes that, and it is not a fudge: the clamp
 * exists to stop the project's BACKGROUND showing, and when the
 * cinematic look is on there is no background to show — the picture is
 * inset on a backdrop, and a backdrop is a thing you are allowed to see.
 * So the travel is extended by that fraction of the canvas, the corner
 * click is genuinely framed, and what fills the vacated edge is the
 * gradient that was always meant to be there.
