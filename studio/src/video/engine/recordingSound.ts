/* ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   Sound design for a take.

   A click you can hear is the difference between watching a recording
   and watching someone use something. It is also the cheapest possible
   upgrade: the sounds are SYNTHESISED by `sfxEngine`, so there is
   nothing to license, nothing to download, and nothing to 404.

   Two layers, and they do different jobs:

     tick    one per real click, very quiet. Ambience. You should not
             notice it; you should notice its absence.
     whoosh  one per zoom push, quieter still and slightly ahead of the
             move. Air, not a sound effect. It is what makes a push feel
             like a camera rather than a scale transform.

   ── Real files, in the take's own folder ───────────────────────────

   `media:writeTemp` exists and would work and puts the file under
   os.tmpdir(), where it lives until the next reboot. Fine for a sound
   somebody auditioned; not fine for the click track of a recording they
   may open next month, which would come back with every sound relinked.
   A take is a folder, so `recorder:writeTakeAsset` puts them in it.

   ── Why individual clips rather than one rendered track ────────────

   Rendering every tick into a single WAV would be faster to export, one
   file and one clip. It would also be the one place in this whole
   feature where something arrives as a render rather than as an edit,
   and the ability to grab one sound and delete it is the point. The cap
   below is the price of that, and it is stated out loud rather than
   applied quietly.
