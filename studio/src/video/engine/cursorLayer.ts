/**
 * The synthetic cursor.
 *
 * `Take.cursor` has existed for as long as the recorder has, sampled at
 * 30Hz and normalised to the captured display's bounds, and until now it
 * was read for exactly one purpose: deciding WHERE to zoom. Nothing
 * drew a pointer. A screen capture on macOS does not include the cursor
 * in the frame, so a tutorial built from a take had no pointer in it at
 * all, and the zooms pushed in on things the viewer could not see being
 * clicked.
 *
 * This draws one. It is not the system arrow: it is the paper-plane dart
 * measured off the reference video, because a synthetic cursor is the
 * one element of a screen recording that is unambiguously ALLOWED to be
 * a designed object rather than a faithful capture, and at phone size a
 * 24px system arrow is invisible while this reads.
 *
 * ── Everything here is measured, and here is what off what ──────────
 *
 * Frames at t=200s (frame at rest) and t=440s (deep zoom) of the
 * reference, both 1920x1080. See
 * `.claude/reference/REFERENCE-VIDEO-ANALYSIS.md`.
 *
 * The one question that decided the whole design was whether the cursor
 * is composited BEFORE the zoom, and so grows with the frame, or after
 * it at a constant size. Two independent rulers put the frame's own
 * magnification between those frames at 1.89x: the big slide numeral
 * grew 79px to 149px (1.886) and the card's border stroke 5.0px to
 * 9.5px (1.90). The cursor's outline grew 56.5px to 99px, which is
 * 1.75x. Constant size would have been 1.00x, so it is not that. It
 * scales with the frame, and that is what `cursorLayerKeyframes` emits.
 *
 * The residual is worth writing down rather than fitting: 1.75 is 93%
 * of 1.89, so either the reference damps the growth slightly or one of
 * the two single-frame cursor samples caught it mid-animation. Two
 * points cannot tell those apart, and the difference at our deepest
 * zoom is under 15% of the icon's size, so this scales it fully and
 * says so out loud.

 *
 * The measured outer boundary of the drawn icon ran corner to corner of

 * puts the STROKED result back on the box.
 *
 * The corners are sharp here and rounded by the stroke's round join,
 * which is how the reference's are rounded too. That matters for the
 * tip: at a 45 degree point a miter join would throw a spike two and a

 *     cx = canvasW/2 + offsetX + baseW * scale * (px - 0.5)
 *
 * and during a zoom span `offsetX` and `scale` are both the same eased
 * fraction of the way between their endpoints. So for a stationary
 * cursor `cx` is AFFINE in that fraction, and one keyframe at each end
 * of the span carrying the span's own easing reproduces the curve
 * exactly rather than approximating it. For a cursor that is moving as
 * well the two curves multiply and it is an approximation, but a
