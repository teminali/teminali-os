/* ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   The look a screen recording needs to stop looking like a screen
   recording.

   A raw capture is a rectangle of someone's desktop, edge to edge, at
   whatever brightness their theme happens to be. Five things can turn that
   into something that reads as shot rather than grabbed, and all five
   are cheap:

     1. **The frame is inset and rounded.** Pulling the picture off the
        edges and rounding its corners is what stops it reading as a
        window and starts it reading as a subject. It is also what makes
        the zoom legible: at rest you can see the whole thing sitting in
        space, and when it pushes in the padding collapses and the
        content fills the frame, which is a MOVE rather than a crop.

     2. **Something behind it.** A gradient, dark, off-axis. The frame
        needs to be inset INTO something; inset into black it just looks
        like a smaller video.

     3. **It opens and closes.** A dip from black at the head and to
        black at the tail. Two half-second clips, and they do more for
        "finished" than anything else here.

     4. **A vignette, barely.** Enough to hold the eye off the corners,
        not enough to darken anything anybody has to read.

     5. **An optional inner edge.** Clean by default means absent. When
        selected, the edge is drawn from the same path as the mask and
        clipped inward, so even a neon glow cannot contaminate the
        backdrop or turn the inset into a larger, fuzzy rectangle.

  ── The light set, and why it is now the front half of the list ─────

  This list used to be three dark gradients and a paragraph explaining
  that a screen recording is mostly bright UI, so a backdrop with any
  real colour in it competes with the thing it is meant to be holding.
  That reasoning is still true and the dark set is still here for the
  cases it is right for — a dark-theme editor, a terminal, a demo shot
  at night.

  It was also, as a DEFAULT, wrong. Every tool people actually make
  screen tutorials with — Screen Studio, Recordly, Tella, Focusee — puts
  the picture on a soft light gradient, and that is not a coincidence of
  taste: a light backdrop reads as PAPER behind a screen, and a dark one
  reads as a video player with a small video in it. The rounded inset
  only looks like an object sitting on something when the something is
  lighter than the object's shadow would be.

  ── Mesh, not ramps ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Four of the five light backdrops carry `blobs`. A two-stop ramp always
  looks like a two-stop ramp: it has a visible direction and a flat
  middle. What those tools ship instead is two or three soft radial
  washes over a near-white base, so the colour pools in corners and
  fades to nothing in the centre, which is where the picture goes. The
  measurement behind the whole feature is on `daylight` below.

  Saturation is kept low on purpose and it is not only taste: the
  verification suites identify the recording by which channel dominates
  a pixel by 40 or more, so a backdrop that is strongly one colour would
  start being counted as footage. `verify.py` asserts the edges are NOT
  the recording, and a violently blue backdrop would quietly turn that
  check into a different check.
