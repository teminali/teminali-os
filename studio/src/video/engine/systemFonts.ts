   Fonts the machine actually has.

   The font picker was nine hardcoded names — Inter, JetBrains Mono,
   Georgia, Impact, Arial Black, Courier New, Times New Roman, Verdana,
   Trebuchet MS — offered identically on every machine. Two problems at
   once: a Mac with three hundred families could use nine of them, and
   several of those nine are Windows fonts that a Mac does not have, so
   picking them silently fell back to the default and the preview did
   not change.

   The agent had it worse. `textStyle.fontFamily` is a plain string with
   no enumeration anywhere, so it could set "Helvetica Neue Condensed
   Black", get a success, and render in Inter.

   Two sources, in order:

     1. `queryLocalFonts()` — the real system list, when the browser
        exposes it and the user allows it.
     2. A candidate list, each entry width-probed against three
        fallbacks — always available, and it answers the question that
        matters: does this name resolve, or fall back?

   Note which API is NOT used: `document.fonts.check()` looks like the
   right call and is not. It reports whether the text can be rendered by
   the font set, which is true for every name because the fallback can
   always render it — it returns true for "Definitely Not A Font".

   Either way the list is MEASURED, never assumed.
