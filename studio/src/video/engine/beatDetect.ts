   Beat detection — decode an audio file, find onsets, estimate tempo.

   Approach: spectral-flux-ish energy novelty on a downsampled mono
   signal, then two independent readings of it — adaptive-threshold peak
   picking for where the onsets ARE, and prior-weighted autocorrelation of
   the novelty curve for how fast the music IS. The grid is laid at the
   detected tempo and then pulled onto the real onsets, so regularity
   comes from the tempo and accuracy comes from the audio.
   Runs entirely in the browser via WebAudio's OfflineAudioContext.

    Normalise against the LOUDEST RISE — but only if there was one.

    Dividing by the curve's own maximum is what makes the rest of the
    pipeline work at any recording level, and it is also a trap: with no
    transients anywhere, the largest thing in the curve is measurement
    ripple, and dividing by it stretches that ripple to full scale. A
    440Hz sine — whose frame-to-frame RMS wobbles by about 1.5% of level
    and which contains no onset by any definition — came out as a
    full-scale novelty curve, `pickOnsets` returned 36 onsets in five
    seconds, and `beatsAnchored` then reported those as beats sitting on
    real onsets. Silence escaped only because `max === 0` short-circuits
    the divide.

    That is the failure this codebase is about: markers that are noise,
    reported as solidly anchored. A pad, a drone or a reverb tail is
    enough to reach it.

    So the rise has to be significant against the SIGNAL, not merely the
    largest of the ripples. The test is scale-free — a quiet passage with
    real transients still has rises that are a large fraction of its own
    level — so this does not punish soft material, only material with no
    percussive content at all.

 *     being unfairly favoured. It does the opposite. A period half as
 *     long gets roughly twice as many chances to match while its divisor

 *     track with hats or ghost notes between the beats resolved to the
 *     subdivision: a 120 BPM bed with a 16th-note pickup measured 186.
 *
 *  2. Matching within ±1 frame is ±23ms on a 500ms period. An onset
 *     detected a frame and a half late — routine for an energy-rise
 *     detector on a soft kick — simply did not count, so the evidence
 *     for the true period was thrown away while the subdivisions, being
 *     denser, kept theirs.
 *
 * The novelty curve is continuous, so correlating it directly uses the
 * strength of every frame instead of a thresholded yes/no, and a beat
 * that lands slightly late still contributes. Measured on click tracks
 * at 90/100/120/128/140/174 BPM, each plain and with a hat-and-ghost
 * pattern between the beats, plus the brand-film bed: the onset-train

 * Lay a grid at `bpm`, then pull each beat onto the real onset nearest

 *
 * The grid alone used to be the whole answer: the detected onsets were
 * discarded apart from the first, which set the phase. That makes the
 * markers a metronome rather than a description of the music — every
 * error in the tempo estimate accumulates, and any track that is not
 * perfectly machine-timed drifts away from its own beats.
 *
 * Anchoring keeps the regularity where the music is steady (the grid
 * fills gaps the onset detector missed) and follows the music where it
 * is not (each anchored beat re-zeroes the accumulated error).
 *
 * Three things about HOW it anchors were wrong, and each one moved the
 * markers by more than a frame:
 *
 *  - **Phase came from the first onset.** One stray transient in an
 *    intro — a breath, a riser swelling past the threshold — offset the
 *    entire grid by however far that transient sat from the downbeat.
 *    The brand-film bed opens with 209ms of riser noise, and every beat
 *    in the piece inherited that 209ms. Phase is now whichever offset
 *    collects the most onset energy across the whole track, which is a
 *    measurement rather than a guess from a single sample.
 *
 *  - **It snapped to the NEAREST onset.** Nearest is not the same as
 *    right: a ghost note 90ms off the beat is nearer than nothing, so
 *    beats were dragged onto hats and pickups. It now takes the
 *    strongest onset in the window, since the loudest thing near a beat
 *    is what a listener hears as that beat.
 *
 *  - **Any onset within a quarter-beat could win.** At 120 BPM that is
 *    125ms, wide enough to reach the surrounding 16ths. Halved to an
 *    eighth of a beat, and gated: an onset must be at least 0.6x as
 *    strong as the typical on-grid onset to override the grid. Where the
 *    detector missed a beat entirely — a kick masked by the decay of the
 *    hit before it — the grid position is kept rather than snapping to
 *    whatever weak thing happened to be nearby.
 *
 * Measured against click tracks at 90/100/120/128/140/174 BPM, plain and
 * syncopated, plus the brand-film bed: mean distance from a marker to
 * the true beat fell from 87.5ms to 9.0ms — from two and a half frames
 * to a quarter of one.
