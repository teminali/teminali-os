   Video decode.

   Until this existed, TeminaliCut could not show video. Every clip — the
   `.mov` files included — was drawn through `getCachedImage()`, which
   builds an `HTMLImageElement`. An <img> cannot decode an MP4, so the
   draw path fell through to its "media still loading" placeholder and
   rendered a dark gradient. Forever.

   Nothing looked wrong because the seed project's "footage" was a set
   of Unsplash JPEGs wearing .mov filenames and a fake ProRes codec
   label. Stills decode fine as images, so the demo looked like a
   working video editor while the only real video path was a gradient.

   Design mirrors `audioEngine`: one <video> element per clip, kept in
   a cache, told the timeline state every frame and reconciled against
   it. The engine owns no clock — the playhead is the only truth — so
   scrubbing, looping and rate changes need no special cases.

   The elements are MUTED on purpose. Sound comes from `audioEngine`,
   which already routes every clip through Web Audio for per-clip gain,
   fades and real metering. Letting the picture element make noise too
   would double every source.
