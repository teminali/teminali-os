  `SHADER_WHIP_PAN_FS` is unreferenced, and unusable as written.

  It takes `u_from` AND `u_to` — two clips crossing — while a
  `ClipTransition` belongs to ONE clip, so `runShader` uploads a single
  texture. Kept rather than deleted: it is a correct two-texture
  cross-transition waiting for a two-texture path, and the reason it
  cannot run today is worth more than the lines it costs.

  Two others that sat beside it have been DELETED rather than
  documented, because they were dead in a way that MISLED.
  `SHADER_RGB_GLITCH_FS` had a ShaderKey, a uniform builder in the
  compositor and a member in the effect-type union — a fully wired path
  that no effect in the registry named, so it never appeared in
  `list_effects` and nothing could ever ask for it. `SHADER_FILM_GRAIN_FS`
  was reachable from nothing at all, and wiring it to the real
  `film_grain` effect would have made that effect SLOWER: a GPU pass
  uploads the canvas and reads it back, ~5ms per clip per frame at 1080p,
  against 0.05ms for the 2D grain it would have replaced (measured during
  the transition work).

  Dead code that advertises a capability is the same failure as a control
  that reports success and does nothing: the next person reads the
  shader, concludes the effect is GPU-accelerated, and is wrong.

/* ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   MESH WARPS — vertex programs.

   Everything above this line is a fragment program: it can decide what
   colour a pixel is, and it can decide which texel to read, but the
   sheet it reads from is always a flat full-screen rectangle. That is
   why `NEXT.md` listed page curl under "still not possible" rather than
   under "not written yet" — a page curl is not a colour decision, it is
   a *shape*. The sheet leaves the plane, folds over itself, and shows
   you its back.

   So `gpuStage` now draws a subdivided grid instead of one quad, and
   these programs move its vertices. The rules that follow from that:

     • **The texture coordinate is never displaced.** `v_texCoord` is the
       undisplaced grid coordinate, always inside 0..1. The image is
       carried BY the geometry, which is what lets a warp push pixels
       outside the source rectangle — a UV-offset fragment warp cannot,
       because it can only ever read what is already there.
     • **Shading comes from the surface slope**, computed here from the
       displacement's own derivative. A fragment program cannot do this:
       it does not know what shape the sheet is. If the shading in these
       warps ever stops tracking the geometry, the geometry is what to
       distrust.
     • **`v_back` says the fragment is looking at the reverse of the
       sheet.** Only the curl folds, so only the curl ever sets it.
     • uv.y = 0 is the BOTTOM of the frame. The stage uploads the layer
       with `UNPACK_FLIP_Y_WEBGL`, so the grid, the angles below and the
       `angle` parameters of the effects that use them are all y-up.

   three exports of each condition:

       transition      composite/frame, GPU    composite/frame, 2D
       none                       0.30 ms                0.36 ms
       crossfade                  0.32 ms                0.29 ms

   A GPU pass uploads the whole canvas as a texture and reads it back
   again, and at 1080p that is about 5 ms per clip per frame — far more
   than the affine transform and alpha that ten of the fourteen actually
   need. So TWO are here, both for quality the 2D canvas cannot reach at
   any price, and the other twelve are deliberately left where they are.

 * composite 0.25 -> 2.99 ms, composite+encode +38.6 ms), and it was not
