/* ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   Audio playback.

   You cannot edit video you cannot hear. Before this, pressing play
   moved the picture in silence — and the transport's level meters
   bounced on Math.random(), so it looked convincingly like sound was
   coming out. (The module that used to live here was called AudioEngine
   and could play one 440Hz beep.)

   Design: each audible clip gets an <audio> element routed through Web
   Audio as a MediaElementAudioSourceNode. That streams from disk rather
   than decoding whole files into memory — a ten-minute track would be
   ~100MB as a raw buffer — while still giving per-clip gain, fades, and
   a real analyser to drive the meters.

   The engine is told the timeline state every frame and reconciles
   against it. It owns no notion of time itself: the playhead is the
   single source of truth, so scrubbing, looping and rate changes all
   work without special cases.
